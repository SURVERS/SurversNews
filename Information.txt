Greetings, my name is Vladislav, and I have created my second global site "Survers News".
In this site, you can publish your news, change the theme of the account, login, change the profile picture, and there are settings.
The version of this site is v1.6
The code may seem unprofessional, but I'm still new to Web development and want to become a pro.
